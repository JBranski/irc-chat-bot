## Summary
This website is to collectively submit ideas that can be added to an IRC chat bot that gets integrated within Twitch. Additionally, for streamers wishing to test out this chat bot they may submit their Twitch username to be added to the bots list of channels to sit in. All username submissions are individually validated to prevent spamming or malicious behavior. All command requests are also individually sorted through before being added to prevent inappropriate content from being added.
